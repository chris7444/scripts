# Site backups
#
# By default online backups of the swarm are performed. If offline backups are wanted, the playbooks verifies that 
# there will be enough managers in the cluster to maintain the quorum after shutting down one docker daemon for the duration
# of the backup. If this is not the case, the backup will not be done.
#
# Backup of the UCP metadata always causes a short interruption of ctrl plane services. See the
# Docker documentation for more info
